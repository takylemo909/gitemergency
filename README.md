This repository contains a minimal e-commerce site built with a React front-end and a .NET backend.

The `/frontend` folder provides a simple React application that loads React from a CDN. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.

The `/backend` folder contains a skeleton .NET Web API with basic authentication support.

## Running Tests

Frontend unit tests are written with Jest and React Testing Library. Backend tests use xUnit and the ASP.NET Core testing framework.
